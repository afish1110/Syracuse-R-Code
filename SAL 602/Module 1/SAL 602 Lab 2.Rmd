JarrenDuran <- 7.9
RafaelDevers <- 3.9
TylerOneil <- 2.6

if ((TylerOneil >= RafaelDevers) & (TylerOneil >= JarrenDuran)){
  print("The top player is Tyler O'Neil")
}else if((RafaelDevers >= TylerOneil) & (RafaelDevers >= JarrenDuran)){
  print("The top player is Rafael Devers")
}else if((JarrenDuran >= TylerOneil) & (JarrenDuran >= RafaelDevers)){

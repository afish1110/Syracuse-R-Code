We will be looking at the 2024 Boston Red Sox batters. We will read in the data from Baseball Reference using a CSV file.

```{r}
RedSoxBatting <- read_csv("C:/Users/Andrew Fish/Documents/Syracuse/SAL 602/Module 2/RedSoxBatting2024.csv")
view(RedSoxBatting)
```

Next we will at the variable BABIP using the mutate function within dplyr.

```{r}
RedSoxBatting %>%
  mutate(BABIP = (H - HR) / (AB - SO - HR + SF)) -> RedSoxBatting
```

Then we will sort the players by BABIP.

```{r}
RedSoxBatting %>%
  arrange(desc(BABIP)) -> RedSoxBatting
```

Finally we will write the mutate data frame back to a CSV file called UpdatedRedSoxBatting2024.csv

```{r}
write_csv(RedSoxBatting, 
          file = "C:/Users/Andrew Fish/Documents/Syracuse/SAL 602/Module 2/UpdatedRedSoxBatting2024.csv")
```
